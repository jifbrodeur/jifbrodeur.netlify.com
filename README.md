LE site web personel de Jean-François Brodeur sur Gatsby, React, et Node.js.

## Note

I've made my website open source for your inspiration, motivation, and curiosity. However, this site is highly customized and personally tailored, and it is not simply a theme. **I encourage you to be creative and create your own theme, design, and content.**

The [Gatsby Advanced Starter](https://github.com/vagr9k/gatsby-advanced-starter/) is a great place to start, and is the base for this blog.

## Features

- Posts and pages in Markdown
- Tags and categories
- Night mode
- DOS mode (404)
- Code theme (starring [New Moon](https://taniarascia.github.io/new-moon))
- Sass (starring [Primitive](https://taniarascia.github.io/primitive))

## Contributing

If you see any typos or formatting errors in a post, or any other issue that needs to be addressed, please do not hesitate to open a pull request and fix it!
